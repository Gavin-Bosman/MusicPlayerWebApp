VUE:
    - inserting dynamic variables in the vue app template
        - include {{var_name}} within the DOM element you wish to insert within
        - i.e. <p> {{Name}} </p>
        - within your component's script include the data() function and output an object containing
        values for the Name variable

    - Click events
        - use vue directive v-on:click="" (can have v-on: any event)
        - shorthand for v-on is @ (i.e. @click="num++")
            - can directly insert JS functionality into the quotes, or refer to a function
            - i.e. v-on:click="myFunc()"
        - include your app methods in a methods {} object within your component's script
    
    - Other useful events
        - @mouseover
        - @mouseleave
        - @dblclick

    - Conditional Rendering
        - use vue directive v-if="some_var" to conditionally toggle display
        - can also use similar v-show="some_var"
            - v-if removes or inserts the element based on some condition
            - v-show toggles css visibility property, so elements still remain in the DOM
        - v-if is more computationally expensive
    
    - looping
        - v-for directive allows you to cycle through a list in your component and display items to the DOM
        - v-for="item in <list>"

    - dynamic attribute binding
        - v-bind:attr="var_name"
        - i.e. v-bind:name="appName"
            - shorthand is : (i.e. :name="appName")
    
    - computed properties
        - data property within your component that depends on other defined properties
        - encapsulate in the computed: {} object within your component

VUE CLI:
    - Each vue component is represented with a component.vue file
    - each component file contains three main sections
        template: html template for the component
        script: where we export the component object
        style: component specific css styling
    - script contains export default {} object which may contain data, methods, computed, etc.

    template refs:
        - accessing dom elements by storing them in a vue variable
        - within your dom element include the ref attr (ref="value")
        - once you have assigned refs to your elements, you access them within your component with:
            - var = this.$refs.ref_name
            - can apply/access any vanilla JS dom manipulation methods to this variable

    Using multiple components:
        - every component will be nested within the root component, App.vue
        

MONGODB:
    - stores collections of documents
        - collections are essentially tables storing one type of document
        - documents represent a single date item, stored in a similar format to json
